# Efficient Fine-Tuning of GPT-2 on TinyStories

This project demonstrates an efficient and robust method for fine-tuning a large language model (LLM)
on a consumer-grade GPU (Google Colab T4) using the `TinyStories` dataset. It is a practical
implementation of advanced parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, designed to be
resilient to interruptions and capable of resuming training automatically.

## üöÄ Key Features & Techniques

*   **Model:** GPT-2
*   **Dataset:** `roneneldan/TinyStories` (streamed for large datasets)
*   **Core PEFT Method:** **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** applied to attention layers (`c_attn`, `c_proj`),
drastically reducing the number of trainable parameters.
*   **Memory Optimization:**
    *   **4-bit Quantization:** via `bitsandbytes` to load the base model.
    *   **Gradient Checkpointing:** to trade compute for VRAM.
*   **Training Resilience:**
    *   **Automatic Checkpoint Resumption:** The script automatically detects the latest saved checkpoint
and resumes training from there, making it ideal for Colab's runtime limitations.
    *   **Progress Tracking:** Logs and validation losses are tracked and displayed.
*   **Advanced Inference:** Includes a generation function with configurable sampling (beam search,
temperature, top-k, top-p) for high-quality story completion.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The notebook is structured into logical sections:
1.  **Project Setup:** Installs dependencies, checks GPU, and mounts Google Drive for saving checkpoints.
2.  **Dataset & Tokenization:** Loads and tokenizes the `TinyStories` dataset with streaming to handle large sizes.
3.  **Training Setup:** Configures the LoRA model, training arguments (`TrainingArguments`), and the `Trainer` with a custom data collator.
4.  **Training Loop:** Handles both fresh training and automatic resumption from the latest checkpoint.
5.  **Generation & Demo:** Provides functions for text generation and a simple IPython widget for an interactive demo.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

The primary workflow is handled within the notebook. The key steps are:

1.  Run the cells to set up the environment and load the model with 4-bit quantization and LoRA.
2.  The training loop will automatically start or resume from the latest checkpoint in the specified `output_dir` (`/content/drive/MyDrive/gpt2_finetune`).
3.  Use the provided `advanced_generation()` function or the interactive widget to generate stories from prompts.

## üìä Results

The training process outputs validation loss metrics, showing a clear downward trend as the model learns to generate more coherent and grammatically correct simple stories.

| Step | Training Loss | Validation Loss |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5000 | 2.138500 | 1.906918 |
| 7500 | 2.044800 | 1.840981 |

## üîÆ Future Improvements

This project provides a foundation that can be extended by:
*   Fine-tuning larger base models (e.g., GPT-2 Medium/Large).
*   Experimenting with different LoRA parameters (`r`, `alpha`, `target_modules`).
*   Pushing the final adapter to the Hugging Face Hub for sharing.
